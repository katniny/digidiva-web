      <h1>How can I become an alpha tester?</h1>
      <h3>Page Updated: Feb 24, 2025</h3>

      <br />

      <p>The simple answer is, you can't.</p>
      <p>The more complex answer is, as much as I'd love to have it public *now*,</p>
      <p>there are many inconsistencies with what DigiDiva says but *actually has*.</p>

      <br />

      <p>For example, DigiDiva says she has strong built-in moderation tools,<p>
      <p>she doesn't (yet).</p>

      <br />

      <p>I just don't want there to be confusion!</p>
